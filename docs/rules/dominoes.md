# Dominoes (Baseline Rules)

Dominoes has multiple variants. V1 should pick **one** and document it clearly. This doc includes the three common families: Block/Draw, All Fives, and Mexican Train.

## Tile Set
Default: **Double-6** (28 tiles). Larger sets for larger groups (Double-9, Double-12).

## Variant A: Block Dominoes (Baseline)
### Deal
- 2 players: 7 tiles each
- 3–4 players: 5–7 tiles each

### Play
- Highest double starts (or highest tile if no doubles).
- Players play to either open end, matching numbers.
- If you cannot play, you **pass** (no drawing).

### End
- Someone goes out, or game blocks.
- In block, lowest pip total wins.
- Optional scoring: winner gains sum of opponents’ remaining pips.

## Variant B: Draw Dominoes
Same as Block, except:
When you can’t play, draw one tile at a time from boneyard until you can play or boneyard is empty.

## Variant C: All Fives (Muggins)
Score points when the sum of open ends is a multiple of 5 after your play.
- Optional **spinner** (first double) allows branching.
- “Muggins” rule: if player fails to claim points, opponent may.

## Variant D: Mexican Train
Uses **Double-12** set. Players build personal trains + a shared train.
Doubles must be “satisfied” by covering.

## V1 Choice (Recommended)
Pick **Block Dominoes** or **Draw Dominoes** for the first implementation.
