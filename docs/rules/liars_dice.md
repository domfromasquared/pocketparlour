# Liar’s Dice (Baseline Rules)

## Objective
Be the last player with dice remaining.

## Setup
- Each player starts with 5 d6 and a cup.
- Players roll simultaneously and keep dice hidden.

## Bidding
A bid is “there are at least X dice showing face Y.”
On your turn:
- **Raise**: higher quantity or same quantity higher face, or
- **Challenge**: call “liar” on previous bid.

## Resolution
Reveal all dice:
- If count ≥ bid, challenger loses one die.
- If count < bid, bidder loses one die.
Loser starts next round.

## Wild Ones (Variant)
If enabled, 1s count as any face for non-one bids.

## V1 Choices
Pick one:
- **No wilds** (simpler).
- **Wild ones** (more common in casual play).

Optional: “Exact/Calza” call for exact bid.
