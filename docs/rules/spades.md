# Spades (Baseline Rules)

## Objective
Partnership trick-taking game (4 players, 2 teams). Each team bids tricks; score by meeting or exceeding bids.

## Setup
- 4 players in fixed partnerships (partners sit across).
- Standard 52-card deck.
- Spades are always trump.

## Hand Flow
1. **Deal**: 13 cards each.
2. **Bidding**: each player bids 0–13 once.
   - Team bid = sum of partners.
3. **Trick Play** (13 tricks):
   - Lead suit must be followed if possible.
   - Spades trump any non-spade.
   - Winner of trick leads next.
4. **Score** based on team bid and bags.

## Core Rules
- **Follow suit is mandatory** if you can.
- **Breaking spades**: spades cannot be led until broken (played on a non-spade trick) unless a player has only spades.
- **Nil**: bid 0; you must take 0 tricks.

## Scoring (Common “Bags” System)
If team **makes** bid:
- Score = 10 x team bid + 1 per overtrick (bag).
If team **misses**:
- Score = −10 x team bid.
If **bags reach 10**:
- −100 penalty, bags reset by 10.

## Nil Scoring (Common)
- Successful Nil: +100
- Failed Nil: −100

## Variants to Decide
- Minimum team bid (e.g., 4).
- Bag penalty threshold.
- Nil scoring amount.
- Allow/deny Blind Nil.
